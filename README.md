# COMM4190 Spring 2024 - Research Project

Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have created new opportunities for mental health care, especially through the use of AI chatbots or Large Language Models (LLMs). These AI technologies have the ability to give accessible, on-demand emotional support by participating in human-like conversations and tailoring replies to user input. Thus, I wanted to examine this specific communicative context and explore whether and how LLMs might be used and the associated implications.

This research project will look at the effects of using AI  in the context of therapy by comparing two alternative LLMs: Claude-3-Opus, a censored AI, and an uncensored LLM. In this therapeutic context, I will engage in a simulated therapy session where I play the role of the patient and the AI serves as the therapist. 

I performed a literature review to figure out the present state of knowledge on AI's implications regarding therapy and mental health. 
By combining literary findings with the results from modeled therapy sessions, I plan on contributing to the increasing amount of work on the use of AI in mental health support.
