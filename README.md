# COMM4190 Spring 2024 - Research Project

* Use this repository for your Research Project


### Overview

* The focus of this project is to either:
  1. Select a theoretical communication framework (e.g. Accomodation Theory) developed to explain human communication behavior and explore its implications for communicating with (in both senses) an LLM.
  2. Examine a specific communicative context or example (e.g. political debate, interaction between customer and service representative, a messaging campaign in health communication, etc.) and explore whether and how LLMs might be used and the associated implications.
 
     
* Write a paper/report in Markdown using Zotero citations.


### Method

* Add notebooks, Markdown files, your BibTex bibliography file, PDFs, images etc. to the repo related to your project.
* The report should be in a Notebook and use the citation extension of JupyterLab to add citations.
* You can render the Notebook to PDF using "Save and Export as" function in JupyterLab.
* You make have additional notebooks or other files to show your empirical LLM work.

I am thinking of having AI play a therapist with me, where I am the patient and the AI tool is the therapist. I am going to probably use both a censored LLM, like Claude-3-opus as they provide very well thought-out text, and then an uncensored LLM, to see if there is a difference in how far they are willing to help or the types of topics they are willing to handle. Right now, I am in the process of finding research that talks about AI's implications for therapy and health & wellness and I hope to coincide those findings with my findings from the AI.
